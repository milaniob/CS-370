Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The majority of the code for this project was given to me. It gave me the necessary code to run the game, access the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The code I created was the code needed to train the model by using Deep Q learning. 


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists attempt to innovate how we live our lives and how productive we can be. 


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach a problem as a computer scientist by evaluating the problem, breaking the problem down by the steps needed to solve it, coding those steps, and then putting all of those together. 


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end user are that I will attempt to never make a system that takes advantage of a user demographic or discriminates against a user demographic. My job is to follow the guidelines of my organization and make sure I perform to what the organization needs, but not at the expense of the end user.
